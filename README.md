Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains personal data analysis projects that I have done utilizing Python, SQL, Excel and PowerBI. Below are some of my highlighted projects, including data visualization, statistical analysis, and data-driven insights.

For these projects, I start by conducting most of my analysis using Python. Additionally, I perform some minor analysis or adjustments in Excel. To replicate the analysis in a database environment, I simulated it in MySQL by uploading the data to my local MySQL instance. Ultimately, I visualized the results and findings by creating a PowerBI dashboard.

These projects reflect my skills in handling diverse datasets and extracting meaningful conclusions to support decision-making. Feel free to check them out and reach out for any questions or feedback.
