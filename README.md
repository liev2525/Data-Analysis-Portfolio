Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains personal data analysis projects that I have done utilizing Python, SQL, Excel and PowerBI. Below are some of my highlighted projects, including data visualization, statistical analysis, and data-driven insights.

For these projects, I start by conducting most of my analysis using Python. Additionally, I perform some minor analysis or adjustments in Excel. To replicate the analysis in a database environment, I simulated it in MySQL by uploading the data to my local MySQL instance. Ultimately, I visualized the results and findings by creating a PowerBI dashboard.

These projects reflect my skills in handling diverse datasets and extracting meaningful conclusions to support decision-making. Feel free to check them out and reach out for any questions or feedback.

##DATA SALES ANALYSIS
In this project, I used a dataset found on kaggle to analyze automotive sales transactions, examining details like Order Number, Quantity Ordered, Price, Product Line, Customer Information, and other pertinent factors. By closely examining important elements such as sales volume, transaction sizes, customer demographics, and specific order details among different automobile models, my aim is to discover significant insights. The goal of this analysis is to offer the management, potential buyers and stakeholders a comprehensive comprehension of automotive sales trends, empowering them to make informed decisions.

Key Objectives and Highlights
Sales Transaction Insights: Examining key sales transaction details such as quantity ordered, pricing, and deal sizes to understand the sales landscape.

Product Line Performance: Evaluating the performance of various product lines across different deal sizes.

Customer and Geographic Analysis: Assessing customer demographics and geographical trends influencing automobile sales.

Potential Sales Forecasting: Utilizing historical sales data and identified trends to develop potential sales forecasts, aiding in strategic planning and decision-making for future sales initiatives.
